# multi-material-single-nozzle

Small post-processing program that makes G-code produced for multi-material single nozzle setup usable. Without such post processing PrusaSlicer jams the filament.

## How to setup

In short:
- download the executable
- write path to the executable in `Print settings` -> `Output options` -> `Post-processing scripts`

See [Post-processing scripts](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/post-processing-scripts_283913) page in Prusa documentation for more details.
